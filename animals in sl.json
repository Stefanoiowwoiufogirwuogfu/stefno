It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, mainly because of habitat loss and degradation. It has also been called “labiated bear” because of its long lower lip and palate used for sucking insects. It has a long, shaggy fur, a mane around the face, and long, sickle-shaped claws. It is lankier than brown and Asian black bears. It shares features of insectivorous mammals and evolved during the Pleistocene from the ancestral brown bear through convergent evolution. Sloth bears breed during spring and early summer and give birth near the beginning of winter. When their territories is encroached upon by humans, they sometimes attack them. Historically, humans have drastically reduced their habitat and diminished their population by hunting them for food and products such as their bacula and claws. Sloth bears have been tamed and used as performing pets." } }

Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white and glossy blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the iris.

The species was once highly prevalent, found in suburban Colombo and the “wet zone” villages areas with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, whilst rain deluges occur during the monsoon seasons but rapid urbanization has led to a significant decrease in the population level of the monkeys. Known as kalu Wadura in Sinhala. It had traditionally been classified within the lutung genus Trachypithecus but was moved to the genus Semnopithecus based on DNA evidence indicating that is it more closely related to the gray langurs." } }
